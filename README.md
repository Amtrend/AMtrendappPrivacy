You should be aware that there are certain things that AMtrend is not responsible for.  Some features of the app will require an active internet connection.  The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but the Developer cannot be held responsible for the app not working fully if you don't have Wi-Fi access and you don't have any of your leftover data  ...

If you are using the app outside of a Wi-Fi zone, you must remember that the terms of your mobile operator agreement will still apply.  As a result, your mobile provider may charge you data transfer fees for the entire connection time when accessing the app or other third party fees.  By using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including data roaming charges, if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e., Region or country) without disabling data roaming.  If you are not the payer of the bill for the device on which you are using the application,

Likewise, the Developer cannot always take responsibility for how you use the application, i.e.  you need to make sure your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery power and you can't turn it on to use the app, Developer accepts no responsibility.

Regarding Developer's responsibility for your use of the app, it is important to remember when using the app that while we strive to keep it updated and corrected, we rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can provide it to you.  Developer is not responsible for any damages, direct or indirect, that you suffer as a result of relying entirely on this application functionality.

At some point, we may want to update the application.  The app is currently available for Android - the system requirements (and for any additional systems that we decide to expand the app's availability to) are subject to change and you need to download updates if you want to continue using the app.  Developer does not promise that it will always update the app to keep it up to date with you and / or work with the version of Android installed on your device.  However, you promise to always accept app updates when they are offered to you.  We may also stop providing the application, and may stop using it at any time without notifying you of the termination.  Unless we notify you otherwise, any termination (a) will terminate the rights and licenses granted to you under these terms;  (b) you must stop using the application and (if necessary) uninstall it from your device.

Changes to these Terms of Use

We may update our Terms from time to time.  Therefore, you are encouraged to periodically review this page for changes.  We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page.
